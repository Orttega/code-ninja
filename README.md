Code Ninja is a TypeRacer based game where you have to type the word that appear in the screen and survive as much as you can! There are 3 PowerUps that may help you on this adventure. The red blob, that eliminates enemies around you in a small radius. the blue blob, that freezes all the enemies in the screen so you can eliminate them easier, and the green blob, repels enemies far from you..
